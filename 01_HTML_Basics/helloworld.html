    <h1>Giant Clam</h1>
    <h2>Anatomy</h2>
    <p>
      Young T. gigas are difficult to distinguish from other species of
      Tridacninae. Adult T. gigas are the only giant clams unable to close their
      shells completely. Even when closed, part of the mantle is visible, unlike
      the very similar T. derasa. However, this can only be recognized with
      increasing age and growth. Small gaps always remain between shells through
      which retracted brownish-yellow mantle can be seen.

    <h3>Largest Specimens</h3>

    <p>
      The largest known T. gigas specimen measured 137 centimetres (4 ft 6 in).
      It was discovered around 1817 on the north western coast of Sumatra,
      Indonesia, and its shells are now on display in a museum in Northern
      Ireland. The joint weight of the two shells is 230 kilograms (510 lb),
      which suggests that the live weight of the animal would have been roughly
      250 kilograms (550 lb).[12][13]
